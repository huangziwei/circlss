# Projected normal location family for mgcv GAMs

A general family implementing distributional regression for a circular
(angular) response \\y\\ in radians under the projected normal law:
\\y\\ is the angle of a bivariate normal with mean \\(\mu_1, \mu_2)\\
and identity covariance. Each mean component gets its own linear
predictor with an identity link, so
[`mgcv::gam`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/mgcv/man/gam.html) is called with a
list of two formulas: the first names the response and models \\\mu_1\\,
the second models \\\mu_2\\.

## Usage

``` r
pnlss(link = list("identity", "identity"))
```

## Arguments

- link:

  Two-element list of link names for the two Cartesian mean components.
  Only `"identity"` is available for both.

## Value

An object of class `c("general.family", "extended.family", "family")`
for use with [`gam`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/mgcv/man/gam.html).

## Details

The fitted mean direction is \\\mathrm{atan2}(\mu_2, \mu_1)\\ and the
implied concentration grows with \\\\\mu\\\\. Because the direction is
assembled from two unconstrained components, there is no link branch
cut: unlike the tan-half parameterization of
[`vmlss`](https://huangziwei.github.io/circlss/reference/vmlss.md), the
fitted mean direction can cross any angle and can *wind* around the
circle (e.g. \\\mu(\varphi) = \varphi\\ with a cyclic covariate), which
makes `pnlss` the natural family for circular-circular regression with
rotation-type association. The trade-off is interpretability: location
and concentration are entangled in \\(\mu_1, \mu_2)\\ rather than
separated into distinct parameters.

Fitted values and `predict(..., type = "response")` return the two
*Cartesian components* \\(\mu_1, \mu_2)\\ as columns, matching the
identity links; compute the direction with `atan2(fit[, 2], fit[, 1])`
and the concentration scale with `sqrt(rowSums(fit^2))`.

Log-likelihood derivatives are implemented to fourth order (full Newton
`method = "REML"`, and `optimizer = "efs"`). The derivative algebra is
transcribed from the finite-difference-verified implementations in the
Python package `pycircstat2`, and fitted results are differentially
tested against it. `"pearson"` residuals alias `"deviance"` (both are
the signed root of twice the log-likelihood gap to the fitted-direction
mode), as in pycircstat2.
